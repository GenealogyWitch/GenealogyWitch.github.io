This means \"John E. Dietrich\" is treated as a business name starting with J and is alphabetized as such. All sources for years of operation are from the Cleveland City directories. It's possible the photographer existed before or after the years they appeared in the directory but knowing when they were advertising helps. The directories do NOT run from January to December, but instead July of the starting year, to June of the following year. It can be confirmed they run this way starting at least 1869 - the 1869 directory is for the year ending June 1870, the 1870 directory is for the year ending June 1871, etc. </p> <p>I have recorded the start year in the tables, so the 1897 reported address is the one reported in the city directory for the year ending July 1898 since that would have been what the photographer reported May or June in 1897.</p> <p>Ancestry got confused about this (not hard to do) and begins with directories beginning in the indexed year. Then they skip 1879 (which isn't truly missing) then say 1880 is for the year ENDING in 1880 instead of starting in it, thus their 1880 directory should be 1879, and 1881 should be 1880, etc if they had stuck to their initial pattern. Then they are actually missing the directory for the year ending 1901 (what the tables would say is the 1900 directory), and 1901 reverts to the old pattern with year beginning 1901 and ending July 1902.</p> <p>If you want to see all available photographers for a given year, and the sources for these tables go to the Cleveland Directories.</p>"},{"location":"cleveland/#bill-overton","title":"Bill &amp; Overton","text":"<p>Studio run by Frank Bill and John Overton</p> Year Address 1890 435 Pearl 1891 435 Pearl 1892 ? 1893 ? 1894 435 Pearl 1895 435 Pearl 1896 435 Pearl 1897 176 Euclid 1898 176 Euclid 1899 none <p>Checking the 1901 directory, (1900 is missing) Bill Frank still lives at 176 Euclid but the combined business is not advertised</p>"},{"location":"cleveland/#freedle","title":"Freedle","text":"<p>Name appears 'Freedle' on the samples I have found, J.
